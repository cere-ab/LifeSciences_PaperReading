    In literature, three techniques for generating embeddings from graphs are
    commonly discussed:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Proximity Preserving} - \textit{where local topological information
            is utilised, e.g., Random Walk, etc.}
        \item \textbf{Message Passing} - \textit{pertains mostly to graph neural
            networks, e.g., R-GCN, etc.}
        \item \textbf{Relation Learning} - \textit{leverages edge properties, e.g.,
            Singular Value Decomposition, etc.}
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent The authors have noted that Proximity Preserving paradigms are not
    very good at capturing global structure information, however, they have not
    explicitly identified shortcomings for the Message Passing paradigm. They have
    identified two \textbf{triplet formats} where, ``\textit{The motive of this
    research is to perform triplet data fusion in a multi-relational heterogeneous
    graph}''.
