%% The positive takeaways from the paper
\section{Positive Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The learnt decomposition approach to embedding learning seems promising
    \item The computation itself seems straightforward
\end{itemize}


%% The negative takeaways from the paper
\section{Negative Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The authors did not perform a compare and contrast exercise for the three
        paradigms mentioned
    \item The Embeddings thus generated may not be portable to other applications
    \item The mapping of gene id or disease id etc. to actual indices of matrix and
        tensor seems to be critical and potentially non-portable!
\end{itemize}


%% The questions that I have of the authors
\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the meaning of concept normalisation for graph node normalisation?
    \item The proof of the update rules and the terms A, V, C are yet to be understood.
\end{enumerate}
