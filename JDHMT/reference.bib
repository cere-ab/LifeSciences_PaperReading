    abstract = {Motivation Node embedding of biological entity network has been
    widely investigated for the downstream application scenarios. To embed full
    semantics of gene and disease, a multi-relational heterogeneous graph is
    considered in a scenario where uni-relation between gene/disease and other
    heterogeneous entities are abundant while multi-relation between gene and
    disease is relatively sparse. After introducing this novel graph format, it
    is illuminative to design a specific data integration algorithm to fully
    capture the graph information and bring embeddings with high quality.
    Results First, a typical multi-relational triple dataset was introduced,
    which carried significant association between gene and disease. Second, we
    curated all human genes and diseases in seven mainstream datasets and
    constructed a large-scale gene-disease network, which compromising 163,024
    nodes and 25,265,607 edges, and relates to 27,165 genes, 2,665 diseases,
    15,067 chemicals, 108,023 mutations, 2,363 pathways, and 7.732 phenotypes.
    Third, we proposed a Joint Decomposition of Heterogeneous Matrix and Tensor
    (JDHMT) model, which integrated all heterogeneous data resources and obtained
    embedding for each gene or disease. Forth, a visualized intrinsic evaluation
    was performed, which investigated the embeddings in terms of interpretable
    data clustering. Furthermore, an extrinsic evaluation was performed in the form
    of linking prediction. Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation results showed
    that JDHMT model outperformed other eleven state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
    which are under relation-learning, proximity-preserving or message-passing
    paradigms. Finally, the constructed gene-disease network, embedding results
    and codes were made available.
