%% The positive takeaways from the paper
\section{Positive Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The setup is a robust method to generate embeddings for gene-prducts.
\end{itemize}


%% The negative takeaways from the paper
\section{Negative Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The actual task, viz., classification and regression, are not well defined;
    as in, the loss functions could have been better explained along with the ways to prepare
    the \textbf{groundtruth}
\end{itemize}


%% The questions that I have of the authors
\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the experiments described, how were the groundtruths prepared?
    \item The exact description of the loss functions?
\end{enumerate}
