    Given a \textit{set} of genes and their \textbf{Gene Ontology annotation}s,
    this paper delves into discovering the process of \textit{learning} \textbf{functional similarity}
    estimation for any gene-pair.  \hfill
    
    Learned embeddings for GO terms and gene-products are the \textit{by-products}
    of the training process.
