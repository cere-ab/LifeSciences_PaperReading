%% The positive takeaways from the paper
\section{Positive Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This study gives a good hint that modality for embeddings' generation 
    is very much task dependent
\end{itemize}


%% The negative takeaways from the paper
\section{Negative Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Too many experimental setups have been crammed into a single paper
    \item The description of the paper could have followed a more structured
        approach
    \item The publicly released source code \cite{modalityChoicesCode} is not
        well structured and/or documented
\end{itemize}


%% The questions that I have of the authors
\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The authors have observed that their study was inconclusive in terms of
        identifying a single robust modality for embedding generation or even
        embedding generation method. In light of that, what was even the point of
        publishing this paper?
